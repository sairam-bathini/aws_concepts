What is a Subnet?
A subnet (subnetwork) is a smaller part of a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS. It helps divide a network into sections to improve security and performance.

Types of Subnets in AWS
1️⃣ Public Subnet 🏢 (Accessible from the Internet)

Has a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW).
Used for hosting web servers, load balancers, and bastion hosts.

2️⃣ Private Subnet 🔒 (Not Accessible from the Internet)

No direct internet access.
Used for databases, application servers, and internal systems.
Can access the internet via NAT Gateway (for outbound requests).

3️⃣ Isolated Subnet 🚫 (Completely Private)

No internet access at all (inbound or outbound).
Used for high-security workloads like sensitive data storage.

Why Use Subnets?
✅ Security – Keep critical resources private.
✅ Performance – Organize and manage traffic better.
✅ Scalability – Efficiently handle large applications.

What is a Load Balancer? ⚖️
A Load Balancer (LB) is like a traffic police officer for your servers. It distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overloaded.

Types of Load Balancers in AWS 🚀
1️⃣ Application Load Balancer (ALB) 🏛️

Works at Layer 7 (Application Layer).
Best for HTTP/HTTPS traffic (websites, APIs).
Can route requests based on URL paths (e.g., /login → Server A, /images → Server B).

2️⃣ Network Load Balancer (NLB) ⚡

Works at Layer 4 (Transport Layer).
Best for high-performance and low-latency applications.
Handles TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic.

3️⃣ Gateway Load Balancer (GLB) 🚪

Used for third-party security appliances (firewalls, IDS/IPS).
Routes traffic to security tools before reaching the backend servers.

4️⃣ Classic Load Balancer (CLB) 🏚️ (Legacy, Not Recommended)

Supports both Layer 4 & Layer 7, but lacks advanced features.

Why Use a Load Balancer?
✅ Scalability – Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
✅ High Availability – If one server fails, traffic is routed to another.
✅ Security – Can integrate with AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall).

What is an Internet Gateway (IGW)? 🌐
An Internet Gateway (IGW) is a bridge between your VPC and the Internet. It allows resources in a public subnet to communicate with the internet.

How IGW Works?
📤 Outbound Traffic – Instances in a public subnet send requests to the internet (e.g., fetching data from a website).
📥 Inbound Traffic – Users on the internet can access services hosted in a public subnet (e.g., a web application).

Key Points About IGW
✅ Required for Public Subnets – Without an IGW, instances can’t connect to the internet.
✅ One IGW Per VPC – A VPC can only have one Internet Gateway.
✅ Needs Route Table Configuration – Public subnets must have a route to the IGW.

How Load Balancer & IGW Work Together? 🤝
1️⃣ A user accesses a website → Request reaches the Internet Gateway (IGW).
2️⃣ IGW forwards the request to the Load Balancer in a public subnet.
3️⃣ Load Balancer distributes traffic to multiple web servers in different subnets.
4️⃣ Web servers process the request and send back a response.
5️⃣ Response goes back via the IGW to the user.
