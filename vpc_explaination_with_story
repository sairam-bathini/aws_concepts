Story: How a User's Request Travels from the Internet to a Private Subnet in AWS

Imagine TechCorp, a startup, has launched its e-commerce website on AWS. Their architecture includes:

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that acts as their private network.
A public subnet hosting a web server (EC2) to handle user requests.
A private subnet hosting a database server, which stores sensitive customer data.
An Internet Gateway (IGW) to allow internet traffic to reach the web server.
A Load Balancer to manage incoming traffic efficiently.
A Security Group to control access.
A Route Table to guide network traffic.

Meet Alex and TechCorp
Alex wants to buy a laptop from TechCorp, an online store hosted on AWS. Let's follow his journey from clicking on the website to getting the product details on his screen.

1. Alex Sends a Request from the Internet
Alex types www.techcorp.com in his browser and hits enter.
His request travels across the internet to reach AWS.

2. Internet Gateway (IGW) Lets the Request In
AWS has an Internet Gateway (IGW) that allows external traffic to enter the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
The Route Table has a rule:
All traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) should go through the IGW.

3. Public Subnet Hosts the Web Server
The public subnet contains the web server (EC2 instance) that serves the website.
A Load Balancer helps distribute traffic among multiple web servers for better performance.
  
4. Security Group Allows Web Traffic
The Security Group of the web server allows only HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) traffic to ensure security.
Since Alex is accessing the website through his browser, his request is accepted.
  
5. Web Server Needs Data from the Database
The web server receives Alexâ€™s request and checks if the data is stored locally.
Since product details are stored in a database, the web server sends a request to the database server.
  
6. Private Subnet Hosts the Secure Database
The database is inside a private subnet to keep it safe from direct internet access.
The Route Table allows communication between the web server (public subnet) and the database (private subnet).
  
7. Database Responds with Product Details
The database server processes the request and retrieves details about the laptop.
It sends this data back to the web server.

8. Web Server Sends Data Back to Alex
The web server takes the database response and creates a webpage for Alex.
The response is sent back through the Internet Gateway (IGW).
Alex now sees the laptop details on his screen.
  
Key Takeaways
ðŸ”¹ Internet Gateway (IGW) allows internet traffic to enter the AWS network.
ðŸ”¹ Public Subnet hosts the web server, which interacts with the user.
ðŸ”¹ Load Balancer distributes traffic among multiple servers.
ðŸ”¹ Security Groups control which types of requests are allowed.
ðŸ”¹ Private Subnet keeps the database isolated and secure.

This is how AWS securely handles Alex's request from the internet to a private subnet! ðŸš€
