AWS Regions and Availability Zones (AZs)

AWS Regions

AWS has 34 Regions worldwide, each a separate geographical area with multiple data centers.
Regions are isolated to ensure fault tolerance and low latency (e.g., us-east-1, ap-south-1).
Factors in choosing a Region: Latency, Compliance, Cost, Service Availability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Availability Zones (AZs)

AWS has 108 Availability Zones (AZs) globally.
Each Region has at least two AZs, which are physically separate data centers connected by high-speed networks.
AZs provide high availability by distributing workloads across different locations (e.g., us-east-1a, us-east-1b).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example
Deploying an app in Mumbai (ap-south-1) across AZs (ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b, ap-south-1c) ensures fault toleranceâ€”if one AZ fails, another takes over.
