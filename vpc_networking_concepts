Here is a basic understanding of the key components mentioned in the transcript:

1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
A VPC is a private network within AWS where you can launch your AWS resources securely.
It is like a virtual data center that provides isolation from other AWS users.
You define the IP address range, create subnets, and control access with security settings.

2. Region
A Region is a geographical area where AWS has multiple data centers.
Example: Mumbai, Ohio, Singapore are AWS regions.
Each region operates independently for better redundancy and compliance.
  
3. Subnet
A Subnet (sub-network) is a smaller section within a VPC.
It helps in organizing resources and controlling access.
There are two types of subnets:
Public Subnet: Connected to the internet, used for web servers.
Private Subnet: Not directly connected to the internet, used for databases, backend services.
  
4. Internet Gateway (IGW)
A gateway that connects your VPC to the internet.
It allows public subnets to communicate with external users.
Without an Internet Gateway, the VPC remains private.

5. Route Table
A Route Table defines how network traffic flows within a VPC.
It decides whether traffic should go to the internet, another subnet, or another VPC.
Public subnets have a route to the Internet Gateway, while private subnets do not.

6. Load Balancer
A Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.
It ensures high availability and better performance.
Example: If a website has 3 servers, the load balancer divides the requests among them.

7. Security Group
A Security Group acts as a firewall for EC2 instances.
It controls inbound and outbound traffic based on rules.
Example: You can allow only SSH (port 22) access from your office IP address.

8. EC2 Instance
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtual server in AWS.
You can deploy applications, databases, and services on EC2 instances.
EC2 instances run inside a VPC and can be in public or private subnets.
