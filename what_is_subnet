What is a Subnet?
A subnet (subnetwork) is a smaller part of a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS. It helps divide a network into sections to improve security and performance.

Types of Subnets in AWS
1️⃣ Public Subnet 🏢 (Accessible from the Internet)

Has a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW).
Used for hosting web servers, load balancers, and bastion hosts.

2️⃣ Private Subnet 🔒 (Not Accessible from the Internet)

No direct internet access.
Used for databases, application servers, and internal systems.
Can access the internet via NAT Gateway (for outbound requests).

3️⃣ Isolated Subnet 🚫 (Completely Private)

No internet access at all (inbound or outbound).
Used for high-security workloads like sensitive data storage.

Why Use Subnets?
✅ Security – Keep critical resources private.
✅ Performance – Organize and manage traffic better.
✅ Scalability – Efficiently handle large applications.
